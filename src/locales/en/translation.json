The fairway cards cover the channels to all ports which are kept open in winter, i.e. most of the major shipping lanes.",
    "additionalDescription": "Fairway cards have been renewed to a digital form, and in the future they will provide further services to the fairway users. They contain facts about the fairway dimensions, navigability and navigational conditions, traffic recommendations and restrictions and traffic services provided. Drawings of the fairway and the harbour are appended. The drawings are not intended for navigational use. They outline the channel alignment and buoyage, the fairway area, safe clearance depths, berths and other places which the text refers to. As a new feature, fairway cards include a tool to estimate vertical movements of vessels on individual fairways.",

The fairway charts will be updated to use this height system at the same time as new coastal maps are published.  Users should ensure that their fairway chart uses the same height system as the coastal map. An updated fairway chart with the N2000 height system can be identified by the text N2000 (BSCD2000) at the top of the card.",
